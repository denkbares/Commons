/**
 * Implementation of a minimized hash set, that retains the order of the stored elements. It is very memory efficient
 * for empty sets of sets of size 1.

 * The MinimizedLinkedHashSet is memory optimized for cases where you have a lot of them but most of the time with only
 * one (or none) element. As most sets will do (but not all), this implementation also supports to explicitly store a
 * null values into the set.
