/**
 * Combines multiple progresses in one ProgressListener.
 * <p>
 * The progress is divided into a set of certain steps with a specified size
 * each. If the progress is updated (by 0% to 100%) only the part of the current
 * step is progressed.
 * <p>
 * Example: you created a CombinedProgressListener of total size 100. The you
 * finished the first step with step size 20 and proceeding with the next step
 * of size 30. Updating the progress to 0% will lead to a percentage of 20% in
 * the decorated ProgressListener, while updating the progress to 100% will lead
 * to a percentage of 50%.
