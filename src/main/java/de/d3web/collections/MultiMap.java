/**
 * An object that maps keys to values. In contrast to an ordinary {@link Map}
 * this map will contain any number of entries even with the same keys.
 * Therefore adding a key/value pair will not overwrite any other key/value pair
 * with the same key. This results to potentially having a set of values for a
 * given key.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The <tt>MultiMap</tt> interface provides five <i>collection views</i>, which
 * allow a map's contents to be viewed as a set of keys, set of values, or set
 * of key-value mappings, set of values for a specific key and a set of keys for
 * a specific value. The <i>order</i> of a map is defined as the order in which
 * the iterators on the map's collection views return their elements. Some
 * implementations, may guarantees as to their order, others, may not.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note: great care must be exercised if mutable objects are used as map keys.
 * The behavior of a map is not specified if the value of an object is changed
 * in a manner that affects <tt>equals</tt> comparisons while the object is a
 * key in the map. A special case of this prohibition is that it is not
 * permissible for a map to contain itself as a key. While it is permissible for
 * a map to contain itself as a value, extreme caution is advised: the
 * <tt>equals</tt> and <tt>hashCode</tt> methods are no longer well defined on
 * such a map.
 * 
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note: bor bidirectional map implementations also great care must be exercised
 * if mutable objects are used as map values (!) for the same reasons as above.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The "destructive" methods contained in this interface, that is, the methods
 * that modify the map on which they operate, are specified to throw
 * <tt>UnsupportedOperationException</tt> if this map does not support the
 * operation. If this is the case, these methods may, but are not required to,
 * throw an <tt>UnsupportedOperationException</tt> if the invocation would have
 * no effect on the map. For example, invoking the {@link #putAll(MultiMap)}
 * method on an unmodifiable map may, but is not required to, throw the
 * exception if the map whose mappings are to be "superimposed" is empty.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Some map implementations have restrictions on the keys and values they may
 * contain. For example, some implementations prohibit null keys and values, and
 * some have restrictions on the types of their keys. Attempting to insert an
 * ineligible key or value throws an unchecked exception, typically
 * <tt>NullPointerException</tt> or <tt>ClassCastException</tt>. Attempting to
 * query the presence of an ineligible key or value may throw an exception, or
 * it may simply return false; some implementations will exhibit the former
 * behavior and some will exhibit the latter. More generally, attempting an
 * operation on an ineligible key or value whose completion would not result in
 * the insertion of an ineligible element into the map may throw an exception or
 * it may succeed, at the option of the implementation. Such exceptions are
 * marked as "optional" in the specification for this interface.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Many methods in Collections Framework interfaces are defined in terms of the
 * {@link Object#equals(Object) equals} method. For example, the specification
 * for the {@link #containsKey(Object) containsKey(Object key)} method says:
 * "returns <tt>true</tt> if and only if this map contains a mapping for a key
 * <tt>k</tt> such that <tt>(key==null ? k==null : key.equals(k))</tt>." This
 * specification should <i>not</i> be construed to imply that invoking
 * <tt>Map.containsKey</tt> with a non-null argument <tt>key</tt> will cause
 * <tt>key.equals(k)</tt> to be invoked for any key <tt>k</tt>. Implementations
 * are free to implement optimizations whereby the <tt>equals</tt> invocation is
 * avoided, for example, by first comparing the hash codes of the two keys. (The
 * {@link Object#hashCode()} specification guarantees that two objects with
 * unequal hash codes cannot be equal.) More generally, implementations of the
 * various Collections Framework interfaces are free to take advantage of the
 * specified behavior of underlying {@link Object} methods wherever the
 * implementor deems it appropriate.
